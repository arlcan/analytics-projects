The data used for this project was from a table named hacker_news where we analized the information about the site.

// top 5 Most popular stories 
SELECT title, score
FROM hacker_news
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;

// Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users. To find out if this is the case for Hacker news
first we must find the sum of the scores
SELECT SUM (SCORE)
FROM hacker_news;

Then it must be pinpointed the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories.

SELECT user, SUM (SCORE)
 FROM hacker_news
 group by user
 having sum(score) > 200
 Order by 2 DESC;
 

// How many times has a link been posted? 
SELECT user,
   COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url LIKE '%watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ%'
GROUP BY user
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

// How much these sites bring traffic to hacker news?
SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
  WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source'
