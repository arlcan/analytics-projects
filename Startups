IN THIS PROJECT WE ANALIZED THE DIFFERENT STARTUPS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND FILTERED BY EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE, VALUE OF COMPANY AND MARTKET PLACE.

// to view the table and familiarize
SELECT * 
FROM startups

// TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPANIES
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM startups; 

//TOTAL VALUE OF COMPANIES 
SELECT SUM(VALUATION)
FROM startups; 

//MAXIMUN AMOUNT OF MONEY RAISED
SELECT MAX(RAISED)
FROM startups; 

// MAXIMUN AMOUNT OF MONEY RAISED DURING SEED STAGE
SELECT MAX(RAISED)
FROM startups
WHERE STAGE = 'SEED'; 

//oldest year a company was founded 
SELECT min(founded) from startups;

//AVERAGE FROM VALUATION 
SELECT AVG(VALUATION) from startups;

// AVERAGE FOR VALUATION FROM EACH CATEGORY
SELECT CATEGORY,  AVG(VALUATION) 
from startups 
GROUP BY CATEGORY;

// AVERAGE FOR VALUATION FROM EACH CATEGORY WITH ROUNDED AVERAGE BY 2 DECIMALS 
SELECT CATEGORY,
ROUND(AVG(VALUATION),2) 
from startups 
GROUP BY CATEGORY;

// DESCENDING ORDER
SELECT CATEGORY,
ROUND(AVG(VALUATION),2) 
from startups 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

// TO FIND THE MOST COMPETITIVE MARKETS FIRST WE MUST RETURN THE CATEGORIES WITHT THE TOTAL OF COMPANIES 
SELECT CATEGORY, COUNT(*)
from startups
GROUP BY CATEGORY;

//TO KNOW THE COMPETITIVE MARKET WE FILTER IN THE CATEGORIES WITH MORE THAN 3 COMPANIES 
SELECT CATEGORY, COUNT(*)
from startups
GROUP BY CATEGORY
HAVING COUNT (*) > 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

// AVERAGE SIZE OF COMPANIES IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS 
SELECT LOCATION, AVG(EMPLOYEES)
from startups
GROUP BY LOCATION;

// FINALLY TO SEE THE LOCATIONS WITH MORE THAN 500 EMPLOYEES
SELECT LOCATION, AVG(EMPLOYEES)
from startups
GROUP BY LOCATION 
HAVING AVG(EMPLOYEES) > 500;
